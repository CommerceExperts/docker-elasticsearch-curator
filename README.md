# This project is no longer maintained

As of November 7th, 2018, I've decided to end my commitment to maintaining this repo and related.

It's been 3 years since I last used Elasticsearch, so I no longer have the motivation it takes to maintain and evolve this project. Also, other projects need all the attention I can give.

It was a great run, **thank you all**.
